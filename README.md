This repository contains all the required modification of the source codes in the WRF(v4.1.5) 
for implementing a parameterization of slantwise covnection (SC). Such SC scheme is developed in 
the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Scieneces at McGill University. The main program of 
SC scheme is "module_cu_slantwise.F" under the folder "phys."
